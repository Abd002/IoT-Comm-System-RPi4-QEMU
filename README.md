# IoT Device Communication System Using C++ with Yocto for Raspberry Pi 4 and QEMU

## Project Overview

This project implements an **IoT device communication system** that transmits sensor data between multiple QEMU client devices and a central server running on a **Raspberry Pi 4**. The communication is facilitated through **TCP and UDP sockets**, implemented in **C++** using **object-oriented principles**. The system supports both **unicast (TCP)** and **multicast (UDP)** server-client applications, with all socket communication abstracted and encapsulated in well-structured, object-oriented classes.
**example when host pc is the server and 2 QEMU clients**
